# UnitBooks

This repository is currently paused and not finished due to other priorities in my life right now, but i have the intention to finish it.

 App for fictional e-commerce using the Google Books API.
 This app was intended to be a study case of some libraries, so the design and concept stuff is pretty rough. 
 
 The focus was to combine Retrofit and Room as a constant datasource, independent of internet connection, to learn how to use the Paging 3 library and to do some parsing/error handling stuff.
